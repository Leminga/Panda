This is your new Play application
=================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.


INSTALL

First, clone the project to your local system

   $ git clone https://github.com/Leminga/Panda.git

Next, go the the local repository directory and
run the activator to download the dependencies,
compile the source code, and run the play
framework.

   $ cd /path/to/local/repository
   $ ./activator

Once the play framwork is running, you may want
to eclipsify your project, in order to import it
to the Eclipse IDE.

Eclipse IDE as a general existing project.
